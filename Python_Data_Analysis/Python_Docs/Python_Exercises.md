## 1. Import and Inspect
- Load the dataset oscar_age_female.csv using pandas.read_csv().
- Display the first few rows using .head().
- What are the column names? Are they formatted properly (no spaces, lowercase, etc.)?
- How many rows and columns are there?
- What data types are in each column?
- Are there any missing values? If so, where?

## 2. Summary Statistics
- What is the average age of Oscar winners in this dataset?
- Who is the youngest and oldest winner? Include their names and movies.
- How many winners were under 30? Over 50?
- What is the age range, standard deviation, and median age?
- Are there more winners in their 20s or 30s?

## 3. Data Visualization
- Create a histogram of ages using seaborn or matplotlib.
- Create a boxplot to visualize the distribution of ages.
- Make a scatterplot of age vs index (or vs year if available).
- Create a bar chart of winners grouped by age ranges (e.g. 20s, 30s, 40s).

## 4. Exploratory Questions
- Has the average age of winners increased or decreased over time?
- What is the most common age range for winning?
- Are there any outliers in the data? Who are they?
- How common are wins among actresses in their 20s compared to older age groups?

## 5. Linear Regression
- Build a linear regression model to predict age based on index (or year).
- What is the slope and intercept of the model?
- What is the R-squared value?
- Plot the regression line on your scatterplot.
- Plot the residuals. Do they appear normally distributed?
