*Self-directed portfolio project in Statistics and Data Analysis - Summer 2025*

## 1. Introduction
This project analyzes the ages of female Oscar winners across different years using Python. It examines how the age at which actresses win the Oscar has varied over time. The goal is to identify trends or patterns in winner age across decades and explore how these may reflect broader industry/cultural changes.

---
## 2. Data Description
- The dataset contains information for 89 female oscar winners, including their weiing their age, name, and movie.
- The data was sourced from the CSV data repository at https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html (`oscar_age_female.csv`).
- GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/txt/gnu_lgpl.txt
- Note that I renamed `oscar_age_female.csv` to `oscar_age_female.csv` to differentiate from the modified dataset.

---
## 3. Methodology
- Imported and cleaned the dataset using Pandas.
-Created visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, scatterplots, and boxplots using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore age distributions and trends.
- Built a simple linear regression model with Scikit-learn to analyze the trend of winner age over time.

---
## 4. Key Insights
- Average Age: The average age of winners is approximately 36 years.
- Youngest Winner: Marlee Matlin, age 21, for Children of a Lesser God.
- Oldest Winner: Jessica Tandy, age 80, for Driving Miss Daisy.
- Most winners were in their 30s.
- The regression line suggests a slight upward trend in age over the decades.
- However, the R² value is relatively low, indicating that year is not a strong predictor of age.
- Most Common Age Range: The most frequent age range for winning was 30–40 years old.

## 5. Reflection and Learning Outcomes
This project reinforced my understanding of Python for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis. Working with summary statistics, charts, and a regression model helped deepen my ability to explore and interpret real-world data.

---
## 6. Conclusion
By using Python, I analyzed real-world data on female Oscar winners’ ages to find trends over time. This project shows how Python is a useful tool for data analysis, visualization, and building models.
