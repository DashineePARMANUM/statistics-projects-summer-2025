# Statistics Projects - Summer 2025

Welcome to my self-directed summer 2025 portfolio of statistics and data analysis projects. This repository showcases hands-on projects designed to build practical skills using tools such as **R**, **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.

## About

As a Statistics undergraduate, I wanted to complement my university coursework by focusing on real-world data projects and sharpening industry-relevant skills. 
This Summer, I am going to complete multiple projects that demonstrate data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

Even after completing them, Iâ€™m continually refining these projects, finding small mistakes, rewording explanations, and tweaking code in an effort to perfect my work and deepen my understanding.

## Projects Overview

| Focus Areas                         | Tools & Skills                 |

| Excel Basics & Data Cleaning        | Excel (formulas, pivot tables) |
| SQL for Data Querying               | SQL (joins, aggregations)      |
| Data Visualization                  | Power BI                       |
| Statistical Analysis & Modeling     | R (tidyverse, modeling)        |
| Python for Data Analysis            | Python (pandas, matplotlib)    |

Each folder contains:
- Project description
