# IN THE WORKS

# Statistics Projects - Summer 2025

Welcome to my self-directed summer 2025 portfolio of statistics and data analysis projects. This repository showcases hands-on projects designed to build practical skills using tools such as **Excel**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, **R**, and **Python**.

## About

As a Statistics undergraduate, I wanted to complement my university coursework by focusing on real-world data projects and sharpening industry-relevant skills. 
This summer, I am completing multiple mini projects that demonstrate data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

Even after completing them, Iâ€™m continually refining these projects, finding small mistakes, rewording explanations, and tweaking code in an effort to perfect my work and deepen my understanding.

## Projects Overview
