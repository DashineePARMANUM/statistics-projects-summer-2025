# Statistics Projects - Summer 2025

Welcome to my self-directed summer 2025 portfolio of statistics and data analysis projects. This repository showcases hands-on projects designed to build practical skills using tools such as **R**, **Python**, **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.

## About

As a Statistics undergraduate, I wanted to complement my university coursework by focusing on real-world data projects and sharpening industry-relevant skills. 
This Summer, I am going to complete multiple projects that demonstrate data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.

## Projects Overview
