**Dashinee Parmanum**  
*Self-directed portfolio project in Statistics and Data Analysis - Summer 2025*

---

This project demonstrates data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling in R using a college freshmen weight and BMI dataset.

## Files and Folders
- **`R_Datasets`**:
  - `freshman_kgs.csv` = Original raw dataset
- **`R_Docs`**:
  - `R_Report.md` = Detailed project overview and insights
  - `R_Process.md` = Step-by-step methodology and formula explanations
  - `R_Exercises.md` = Exercises/Questions
- **`R_Scripts`**:
  - `R_Final.R` = code with explanation
  - `R_Final+Ans.R` = code with output
- **`R_Images`** = Screenshots
    
## Key Features
- Data import and inspection using *read.csv*.
- Summary statistics and exploratory data analysis.
- Data visualization with *ggplot2* (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots).
- Statistical inference via t-tests for group comparisons using built-in functions.
- Linear regression modeling using *lm* function with residual diagnostics.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning.
- Data visualization.
- Application of hypothesis testing.
- Building and interpreting linear regression models.
- Diagnostic assessment of model assumptions.

## Usage
- Download `freshman_kgs.csv` and place it in your working directory.
- Run `R_Final.R` or `R_Final+Ans.R` scripts (`R_Scripts`).
- Ensure `freshman_kgs.csv` is loaded into R.
- Review the detailed analysis and key insights in `R_Report.md` (`R_Docs`).
