## 1. Data Loading and Inspection
- Load the dataset and inspect the structure using *str()*, *summary()*, and *head()*.
- Check for missing values and duplicates. Report how many, and handle them appropriately.
- Rename or relabel any unclear columns for better clarity (e.g., change *sex* to *Sex*, etc.). 

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, min, max) for weight and height.
- Visualize:
  - Histogram of weight
  - Histogram of height
  - Boxplot of weight grouped by sex
  - Scatterplot of height vs. weight
- Based on the visuals, describe any patterns, trends, or outliers.

## 3. Statistical Testing
- Test whether the average weight differs significantly between male and female students. State your hypothesis clearly and use the appropriate test.
- Test whether height and weight are significantly correlated. Report the correlation coefficient and p-value.
- Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean weight. Interpret it in the context of the dataset.

## 4. Modeling (Regression)
- Fit a simple linear regression: predict weight from height.
- Fit a multiple linear regression: predict weight using height and sex.
- Assess model fit using:
  - R-squared
  - Residual plot
  - Significance of predictors (p-values)
- Interpret the coefficients: What does a 1 cm increase in height imply? How does sex affect the prediction?
