## 1. Import and Inspect
- Load the dataset into R and display the first few rows.
- What are the column names? Are they formatted properly (no spaces, lowercase, etc.)?
- How many rows and columns are there?
- What data types are in each column?
- Are there any missing values? If so, where?

## 2. Summary Statistics
- hat is the average September weight and April weight for the full group?
- Compute the average weight change from September to April.
- Do males or females have a higher average weight change?
- What is the standard deviation of BMI in September vs April?
- Which student gained the most weight?

## 3. Data Visualization
- Create a histogram of April weights.
- Create a boxplot comparing April BMI by sex.
- Make a scatterplot of September vs April weight.
- Add a regression line to the scatterplot.
- Plot a histogram of weight changes (April - September).

## 4. Statistical Testing
- Perform a paired t-test to determine if average weight changed significantly from September to April.
- Perform an independent t-test to compare weight change between males and females.
- State your conclusions from the t-tests in plain language.

## 5. Linear Regression
- Build a linear regression model to predict April weight using September weight.
- What is the slope and intercept? Interpret them.
- What is the R-squared value?
- Plot the residuals and check if they seem normally distributed.
