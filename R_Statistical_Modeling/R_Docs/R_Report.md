## 1. Introduction
This project looks at weight and BMI changes in college freshmen over the academic year using R. It explores overall trends in the data and includes some comparisons between males and females. The goal is to understand how studentsâ€™ weight and BMI changed during the school year.

---
## 2. Data Description
- The dataset contains information for 67 students, including their weight in September and April, and their BMI in Septmeber and April.
- The data was sourced from the CSV data repository at https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html (`freshman_kgs.csv`).

## 3. Methodology
- Imported the data using the *read.csv* function and inspected the data for missing values.
- Calculated summary statistics such as Average Weight in September.
- Visualized data using *ggplot2* library.
- Performed Statistical Testing, speciifaclly t-tests.
- Build a linear regresison model using *lm* function.

---
## 4. Key Insights
- The average weight of students changed significantly from September to April.
- There was no statistically significant difference in average weight change between males and females from September to April.
- The strongest predictor of April weight is September weight, with a high R-squared value (~0.88), indicating a strong linear relationship.
