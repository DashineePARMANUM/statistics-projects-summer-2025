*Self-directed portfolio project in Statistics and Data Analysis — Summer 2025*

---
## 1. Introduction
This report explores a student grades dataset using Power BI to create clear, interactive visualizations and uncover patterns in student performance.

---
## 2. Data Description
- The dataset contains 16 student records with fields for last name, first name, four test scores (Test1–Test4), a final exam score, and the overall grade.
- The data was sourced from the CSV data repository at https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html (`grades.csv`).
- GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/txt/gnu_lgpl.txt

---
## 3. Methodology
- Imported the data from `grades.csv` and transformed (use first row as headers + remvoe commas) it for ease of use.
- Created multiple slides:
  - *BarChart-AvgTest* = Chart 1.1: Average Test Score (bar chart)
  -  *ColChart-Final* = Chart 2.1: Final Score by Student (column chart)
  -  *PieChart-Letter* = Cahrt 3.1: Letter Grade Distribution (pie chart)
  -  *Basic Visuals* = chart compilation
  -  *Slicers* = duplicate of *Basic Visuals* with slicers added
  -  *Cards*: Card 1.1: Number of Student + Card 2.1: Average Final Score + Card 3.1: Highest Test 1 + Card 4.1 = Overall Average Test Score Measure (measure was created for Overall Average Test Score)
  -  *Tooltips* = duplicate of *Basic Visuals* with Tooltips added to pie and bar charts.
  -  *Dashboard* = charts, slicers, cards and tooltips compilation

---
## 4. Key Insights
- Students with higher average test scores generally received higher final grades.
- The majority of students fall into the B grade as seen on the pie chart.
- The lowest performance on average occurred in Test 2, as shown in the bar chart.
