## 1. Import and Clean Data
- Import data.
- Inspect the fields: Rename them if needed.
- Set appropriate data types.

## 2. Create Basic Visuals
- Create a bar chart showing the average score of each test.
- Create a column chart showing the final scores by student.
- Create a pie chart or donut chart showing the distribution of letter grades.

## 3. Use Slicers and Filters
- Add a slicer to filter by *Grade* (e.g., A, B, C).
- Add a second slicer to filter by *Last Name* (alphabetically or search box).
- Try combining filters (e.g., show only students with *Grade* "A" whose *Last Name* starts with “M”).

## 4. Create Cards and KPIs
- Add a Card to show the number of students.
- Add a Card to show the average Final Score.
- Add a Card showing the highest Test 1 score.

## 5. Write Basic DAX
- Create a calculated column called *AvgTestScore*.
- Create a measure for the overall average of all students' 1*AvgTestScore*.
- Add a Card for this measure.

## 6. Add Tooltips and Interactions
- Add tooltips to your charts (e.g., when hovering over a bar, show student name and average score).
- Customize interactions between charts (e.g., clicking a slice of the pie filters the bar chart).

## 7.  Create a Simple Dashboard
- Arrange your charts, slicers, and cards into a clean layout on one page.
- Name the page *Student Performance Dashboard*.
- Add a title using a Text box.
- Format colors and fonts for readability.
