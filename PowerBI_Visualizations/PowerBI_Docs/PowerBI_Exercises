# Power BI Visualization: Grades Dataset

**Dashinee Parmanum**  
*Self-directed portfolio project in Statistics and Data Analysis — Summer 2025*

---

## 1. Import and Clean Data
- Import data.
- Inspect the fields: Rename them if needed.
- Set appropriate data types.

## 2. Create Basic Visuals
- Create a **bar chart** showing the average score of each test.
- Create a **column chart** showing the final scores by student.
- Create a **pie chart** or **donut chart** showing the distribution of letter grades.

## 3. Use Slicers and Filters
- Add a **slicer** to filter by `Grade` (e.g., A, B, C).
- Add a second slicer to filter by `Last Name` (alphabetically or search box).
- Try combining filters (e.g., show only students with Grade "A" whose last name starts with “M”).

## 4. Create Cards and KPIs
- Add a **Card** to show the number of students (`Count`).
- Add a Card to show the **average Final Score**.
- Add a Card showing the **highest Test 1 score**.

## ✅ Exercise 5: Write Basic DAX
**Goal:** Learn to create new calculated fields.

1. Create a **calculated column** called `AvgTestScore`:

   ```DAX
   AvgTestScore = ([Test1] + [Test2] + [Test3] + [Test4]) / 4
