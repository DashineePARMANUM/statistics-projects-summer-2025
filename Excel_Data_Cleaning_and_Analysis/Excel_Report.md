## 1. Introduction
This report documents the analysis of a home sales dataset using Microsoft Excel, focusing on cleaning raw data, deriving meaningful metrics, and creating visualizations to explore real estate trends.

---
## 2. Data Description
The dataset contains information on 50 homes, including sale and asking prices, physical characteristics, age, and taxation. The data was sourced from the CSV data repository at https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html.

---
## 3. Methodology
The cleaning process involved calculating price differences and categorizing homes as “expensive” based on price thresholds. Key Excel features utilized included conditional formatting to highlight data patterns, logical formulas (IF, SUMIF, COUNTIF) to aggregate information, and lookup functions (VLOOKUP) for enriching data with agent information.

Pivot tables summarized average prices by bedrooms and taxes by home age, complemented by charts for visual trend identification. An interactive dashboard was built to enable dynamic filtering of results.

## 4. Key Insights
- Six-bedroom homes tend to command the highest average selling prices.
- A positive correlation exists between living space and selling price, confirming intuitive real estate market trends.
- Properties categorized as “expensive” mostly exceed the $150k price point.
- Tax amounts generally increase with property age and size.
