## 1. Introduction
This report documents the analysis of a home sales dataset using Microsoft Excel, focusing on cleaning raw data, deriving meaningful metrics, and creating visualizations to explore real estate trends.

## 2. Data Description
The dataset contains information on 50 homes, including sale and asking prices, physical characteristics, age, and taxation. The data was sourced from the CSV data repository at https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html (homes.csv)

## 3. Methodology
Before analysis, I calculated price differences and categorized homes as “expensive” based on price thresholds. Key Excel features utilized included conditional formatting to highlight data patterns, logical formulas (IF, SUMIF, COUNTIF) to aggregate information, and lookup functions (VLOOKUP) for enriching data with agent information.
Pivot tables:
- summarized average prices by bedrooms - Table 1.1 in pivot table sheet
- summarized total taxes by age groups - Table 2.1 in pivot table sheet
- summarized total selling price by age group - Table 3.1 in pivot table sheet
Charts: 
- bar chart of average selling price by numebr of bedrooms (derived from Table 1.1) - Chart 1.1 in chart sheet
- scatter plot of living space vs selling Price (derived directly from Sell and Living Space columns of data sheet) - chart 2.1 in chart sheet
- line chart showing total Selling Price across age groups (derived from Table 3.1) - Chart 3.1 in chart sheet

## 4. Key Insights
- Six-bedroom homes tend to command the highest average selling prices.
- A positive correlation exists between living space and selling price, confirming intuitive real estate market trends.
- Properties categorized as “expensive” mostly exceed the $150k price point.
- Tax amounts generally increase with property age and size.
