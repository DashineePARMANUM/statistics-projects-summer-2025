## 1. Basic SELECT and Filtering
- Show all records from the dataset (limit to 10 rows).
- Retrieve all players where Age is greater than 25.
- Select Name and Height in inches, and create a new column showing Height in centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 cm).

## 2. Conditional Columns (CASE / IF logic)
- Create a column `Is_Heavy` that returns “Yes” if Weight is greater than 200 pounds, otherwise “No”.

## 3. Aggregations and Grouping
- Count the total number of players.
- Calculate the average Age of all players.
- Find the number of players per Team.
- Calculate the average Height and average Weight for each Position.

## 4. Conditional Aggregations
- Count how many players are older than 30 years.
- Find the average Weight for players taller than 72 inches.

## 5. Joins / Lookups
- Create a small lookup table for Team information (e.g., Team name and Home City).
- Write a query to join player data with team info to show each player’s Name, Team, and Home City.

## 6. Sorting and Limits
- Retrieve the top 5 heaviest players with their names and weights.

## 7. Window Functions (optional/advanced)
- Display each player’s Name, Position, Weight, and the average Weight for their Position in the same result.

## 8. Summary Tables / Views
- Create a summary view/table that shows average Height, Weight, and Age grouped by Team.
- Query this summary view/table sorted by average Height descending.

## 9. Constraints and Data Validation (conceptual)
- Write a statement to add a constraint to ensure Age is always greater than zero.
