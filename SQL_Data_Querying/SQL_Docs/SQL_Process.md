## 0. Original Data and Setup
- `mlb_players.csv` contains 1034 major league baseball players including their names, teams, positions, heights (in inches), weights (in pounds), and ages (CSV data repository at https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html - GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007: https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/txt/gnu_lgpl.txt).
- Rename `mlb_players.csv` to `mlb_players_raw.csv` to differentiate from modifed dataset.
- Created `mlb_players.csv` which is the modified dataset (removed special characters and renaming columns for compatibility/ease when using SQL).
- All SQL work was conducted using the pgAdmin application, connected to a local PostgreSQL server.
- Created a new dataset *statistics-projects-summer-2025* and table *mlb_players*.
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mlb_players;
  CREATE TABLE mlb_players (Name VARCHAR(100), Team VARCHAR(10), Position VARCHAR(20), Height INT, Weight INT, Age FLOAT);
  ```
- Used *COPY* to import data from `mlb_players.csv` into table *mlb_players*.
  ```sql
  COPY mlb_players(Name, Team, Position, Height, Weight, Age) FROM 'C:\temp\mlb_players.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
  ```

## 1. Basic SELECT and Filtering
```sql
-- Show all records from the dataset (limit to 10 rows)
SELECT * FROM mlb_players LIMIT 10;

-- Retrieve all players where Age is greater than 25
SELECT * FROM mlb_players WHERE Age > 25;

-- Select Name and Height in inches, and create a new column showing Height in centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 cm)
SELECT Name, Height, Height * 2.54 AS Height_cm FROM mlb_players;
```
